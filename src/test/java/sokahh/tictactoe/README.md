# Your Tests

Place your tests here. There are no test stubs as it is totally up to you
how to actually implement the Kata. Any predefined test might influence
your further decisions.

Nevertheless some libraries have been added to the project dependencies
for testing purpose which might be suitable for you. But don't hesitate
to introduce different dependencies. Recommendation is to take those
you feel comfortable with in order to keep up the pace.

# Suggested Test Libraries

* **[JUnit][]** - suggested to be used to write your tests
* **[Hamcrest Matcher][Hamcrest]** - suggested in case you need some complex comparison

[Hamcrest]: <http://hamcrest.org/> "Matchers to compare actual and expected result"
[JUnit]: <http://junit.org/> "Unit Testing Library"
