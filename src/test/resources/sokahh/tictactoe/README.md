# Test Resources

Actually this folder only exists in order to keep it occupied when doing a VCS revert which might
also delete empty directories. But in addition you will find a text file describing the requested
state of the UI for an empty board.

You might not want to use it... it's just an offer to have it at hand very quickly.
