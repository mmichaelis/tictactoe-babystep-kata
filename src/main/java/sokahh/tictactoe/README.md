# Your Code

Place your code here... if you ever get that far. As you do TDD the recommendation is first
to start with Inner Classes to have all your code at hand and make it production code in
the refactoring phases.

# Suggested Libraries

* **[Guava][]**

   I like the library and it provides for example a rich API to deal with collections. If you are at your
   2 minutes limit it might not make sense to get into touch with Guava then the first time. But on repetition you might find this library helpful.
